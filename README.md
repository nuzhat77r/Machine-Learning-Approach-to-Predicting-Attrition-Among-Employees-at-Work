##### Employee attrition for any organization is a major problem. The rate of quitting jobs may cause the loss of talented employees as well as the loss of time and money to any organization. Machine learning techniques have been found to be effective in assisting organizations and decision-makers in minimizing employee attrition. In this paper, we report a machine learning based approach applied on IBM Watson dataset to predicting employee attrition. Several classifiers such as ZeroR, Decision Tree, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest as well as Voting Classifier were applied on the dataset. Hyperparameter optimization was applied to further improve the results. Our best model leveraging an ensemble technique with a Voting classifier demonstrates that the employee attrition model can achieve a high AUC (Area Under ROC Curve) score of 0.89, including competitive metrics on other measures like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy having a score of 0.90, 0.88, 0.85 and 0.88 respectively.
